In this Farewell,
there’s no blood,
there’s no alibi.
‘cause I’ve drawn regret,
from the truth,
of a thousand lies.

So let mercy come,
and wash away…

What I’ve Done.
I’ll face myself,
to cross out what I’ve become.
erase myself,
and let go of what I’ve done.

Put to rest,
what you thought of me.
while I clean this slate,
with the hands,
of uncertainty.

So let mercy come,
and wash away…

What I’ve Done.
I’ll face myself,
to cross out what I’ve become.
erase myself,
and let go of what I’ve done.

For what I’ve done

I'll start again,
and whatever pain may come.
today this ends,
I’m forgiving what I’ve done.

I’ll face myself,
to cross out what I’ve become.
erase myself,
and let go of what I’ve done.
what I’ve done...
Forgiving what I’ve done...
